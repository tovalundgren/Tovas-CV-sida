            <p class="project-text">I've been living in different countries, met a lot of different people and experienced a lot of different cultures. What I've noticed, especially in the more fragile populations and areas, is that people feel a connection to the outside world through their smartphones. I want to make the web even more accesible to everyone. Let's connect!</p>

                    <p class="scroll">I lived on Svalbard where I worked as an event coordinator for Svalbard Turn, the local sports center. I arranged sport events, Svalbard Ski Marathon among others, took care of the daily operation and of course made sure we had the best possible polar bear protection! In the future I hope to attract more people to Svalbard, its surreal nature and amazing experiences!</p>

                    <p class="scroll">I lived in Nongyang, a tiny village a few hours inland from Bangkok, where I was an English teacher. No one spoke english, there was a gap between the floor and walls in my small hut so I got alot off new animal friends and the toilets were holes in the ground. It was very fascinating how the village seemed to have stopped a hundred years back in time, but all the villagers still had smartphones. Most of them had never left the village, but their smartphones was a way of having a connection with the outside world. A moment of belonging to something bigger. One day I'll make them their own website so you can get to know them too.</p>

                    <p class="scroll">I ran a transport company in Gothenburg. I'm an open-minded yes-sayer so I did everything from economy to lifting pianos and driving trucks. In the beginning our main marketing was through buzz, so a Google search was often our customers' next step to reach us. Therefore, we needed a website that convinced the customer that it was us who would do the job! It became my responsibility to take care of it, and right then and there I knew that fullstack developer was my calling!</p>

                    <p class="scroll">Santiago. Motorcycle tours in the mountains, incredible wineries and Sunday dinners with "the family". Despite the language barrier, a more welcoming culture probably cannot be found. Here, too, I was an English teacher. I lived in a gated community, almost all students had nannies and the school food was great. A huge contrast to my other experiences and travels! Outside our enclosure was a smaller area where people lived in sheds and you had to walk sideways to move around in the area. Many lived outside so sometimes you had to interupt someones nap when you walked between the sheds. Next time I'll work there instead!</p>
